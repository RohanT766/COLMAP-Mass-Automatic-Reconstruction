# COLMAP-Mass-Automatic-Reconstruction
This script automates the process of running the COLMAP automatic reconstructor on a set of subfolders within the "root_folder" directory. It creates a separate workspace for each subfolder and performs 3D reconstruction on the images located in each subfolder.
